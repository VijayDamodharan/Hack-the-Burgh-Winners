What is it

Once in a while, we are faced with making Ô¨Ånancial decisions. These may involve anything from taking a loan from a bank to purchasing a house or a car; or investing money in bonds, stocks or other securities. Intelligent wealth management means borrowing and investing wisely.  Compound Interest is considered a wise investment strategy. Briefly, compound interest is the accumulation of interest over a previous period, based on the initial capital and all the deposits that were made over time. That results in reinvesting interest instead of withdrawing profits.
