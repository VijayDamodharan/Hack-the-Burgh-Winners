Ever thought about investing and just went “nah I can’t bother with that, it has too much things to know about” or “it’s too risky, I don’t want to lose my money!”? Well, what if I told you….that’s all wrong? What if I told you, investing is actually not as hard as you imagined? Just as an example, suppose a gold chain costs £100. You buy it. Few years down the line, you find out your gold coin is now £1000, and you sell it. You see what happened there? You just gained another 0 in your bank account! It is a game of risk, yeah, but a fun one! And is veeeery profitable.
