What is a Black Swan Event

A black swan is an unpredictable event that is beyond what is normally expected of a situation and has potentially severe consequences. Black swan events are characterized by their extreme rarity, severe impact, and the widespread insistence they were obvious in hindsight. Does this sort of event sound familiar? The pandemic we are facing right now is an example! 

How to tackle it

Diversification. What this basically means, is to invest in multiple sectors. Suppose you had invested in the hotel sector right before the pandemic….that would not have done well at this time. But imagine you had invested in not only hotels, but also in retail, tech, HEALTHCARE (!!!), you may have suffered a few losses, but you would have also gained profits! In fact, had you only invested in Healthcare, the “black swan” would have worked out as a “white swan” for you ;)
